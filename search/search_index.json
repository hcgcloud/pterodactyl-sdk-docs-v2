Account API \u00b6 Note You can find functions available for Account API in the client tab of the navigation. Account API is for a single user of your panel, it can perform like Send console command and Send power action while Application API can't. You can generate a key for an administrator account, then you can have the rights to control all servers. Can be generated from: https://yourpanel.url/account/api Application API \u00b6 Application API is for your panel itself, it can perform like Create Server and Create Node while Account API can't. Can be generated from: https://yourpanel.url/admin/api Example \u00b6 Using the pterodactyl instance you may perform multiple actions as well as retrieve the different resources Pterodactyl's API provides, here are some examples using Application API : $servers = $pterodactyl->servers(); This will give you an array of servers that you have access to, each server is represented by an instance of HCGCloud\\Pterodactyl\\Resources\\Server , this instance has multiple public properties like $name , $id , $owner , $memory , and others.
